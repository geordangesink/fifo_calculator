########Create objects for each coin pair

    sum of profit of each financial tool used
        ___________________________________________________________________________________________

        profits: isolated_margin

            difference of value bought vs. sold in USDT (sell_value - buy_value)

                simulate FIFO (first in first out) method:

                    Buy (#########check for right coin pair first)
                        at what price is every single coin bought? at what price are the fractionals bought?

                            create list of "coin amount bought" with each item <= 1 (one coin per item and fractional)
                                the list is in order of the transaction (eg.: coin amount of first buy transaction = 3.25 ; list is appended by 1,1,1,0.25)

                            create list of coin price bought
                                list has the same length as "coin amount bought" list and is aligned to the coins baught with corresponding price

                    Sell (########check for right coin pair first)
                        at what price is every single coin sold? at what price are the fractionals sold?

                            create list of "coin amount sold" with each item <= 1 (one coin per item and fractional)
                                the list is in order of the transaction (eg.: coin amount of first sell transaction = 5.13 ; list is appended by 1,1,1,1,1,0.13)

                            create list of coin price sold
                                list has the same length as "coin amount sold" list and is aligned to the coins baught with corresponding price

                    "volume" (coin amount * coin price) of first single coin sold is substracted by "volume" first sigle coin bought and difference added to "profist" 
                    (repeated until either of the coin amount (sell/buy pair) is samller than the other one)

                        bigger amount is substracted by smaller amount and assigned to "left over".
                        "volume" is calculated using smaller amount for both prices.
                        difference of "volume" is then added to "profits"
                        "left over" is then compared with "next amount" of previously smaller and same thing is repeated until "next amount" is bigger or equal
                            if "next amount" is bigger or equal, "profits" will be added using amount of "left over", "next amount" is substracted by "left over and "left over is set to 0

                        if there is no "next amount" the rest of all the amounts form the side with "left over" are added to "open amount" ("left over" is also added)

            substract buy and sell fees
                substraact the sum of csv column "Fee"

            return "profits" and "open amounts"
